    "# Alphabet Soup's Charity Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Alphabet Soup is a fictional nonprofit foundation that makes donations to various organizations that aim to make the world a better place by protecting the environment, improving people's well-being, etc. Unfortunately, not every investment by the foundation is impactful. The goal of this project is to come up with a data-driven solution to help ensure that the foundation's money is going to organizations that are worth donating to. The solution is to build a model to assess an organization's risk before donating to them."
